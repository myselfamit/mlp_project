My Contribution:
I forecasted CO levels (single feature, daily frequency) using the UCI Air Quality dataset. This is significant because:
- It applies Autoformer to pollution forecasting.
- CO prediction supports public health.
- Achieved MSE=1.4926, MAE=0.7056.

Challenges:
- Modified data_loader.py for daily frequency.
- Cleaned air_quality1.csv.

Results:
Autoformer shows promise for environmental data.
